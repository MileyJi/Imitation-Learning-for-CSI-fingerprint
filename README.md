# Imitation-Learning-for-CSI-fingerprint
 
This repository contains the code for a submitted paper to the IEEE journal.

# Dependencies
Before using this code, you need to install the following dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
To use the dataset, look at [CSI-dataset](https://github.com/qiang5love1314/CSI-dataset).

## Example Readmes

To see how the specification has been applied, see the [imitationLearn_Lab.py](https://github.com/qiang5love1314/Imitation-Learning-for-CSI-fingerprint/blob/main/imitationLearn_Lab.py) and [imitationLearn_Meet.py](https://github.com/qiang5love1314/Imitation-Learning-for-CSI-fingerprint/blob/main/imitationLearn_Meet.py).
In addition, the paper also utilize our previous work [Path Planning for Adaptive CSI Map Construction With A3C in Dynamic Environments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9629332) for obtaining the optimal path, and you can refer to the [code](https://github.com/qiang5love1314/Path-planning-based-on-A3C) for more details.
